# CheXpert + FastAI
Leveraging Fast AI to develop Deep Learning Model for Chest X-Ray Classification trained on CheXpert Dataset.

## Installing PyTorch
* Installing using pip:
`pip install pytorch`

## Installing FastAI
* Here is the [link](https://docs.fast.ai/#Installing) to directions for installing FastAI.
* Installing using pip:
`pip install fastai`

## Directory Structure:
* models: Contains Jupyter notebooks for the various models that we trained and supporting python scripts where we defined our helper functions.
* saves: CSV files from the model trainings and optimal model trained for each variation of models that we tried.
* dataset: .pkl files generated for the dataset that we used.
